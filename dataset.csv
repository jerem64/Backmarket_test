BAHIA COCOA REVIEW,"Showers continued throughout the week in
the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER,"BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    ""The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,""
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    ""I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could,"" said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

DEAN FOODS &lt;DF> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR EARNINGS,"Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the
fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings ""will probably be off slightly"" from last year's 40
cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
anticipated fourth quarter performance would be ""enough for us
to exceed the prior year's overall earnings"" of 1.53 dlrs a
share.
    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience ""a 20 pct
improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
act alone.""
    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
Chicago.
    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods

BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT,"Venezuela and its bank advisory
committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of
a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last
February, bankers said.
    They declined to disclose details because two or three
representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval
of their senior management for the new terms.
    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and
could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,
the bankers said.
    ""A number of details have still to be finalized, but the
broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest
rates are in place,"" one senior banker said.
    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at
1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier
terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due
to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that
it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -
and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new
investment in Venezuela.
    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been
going on intermittently for several months, follows the
announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt
rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.
    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,
including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.
    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,
bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes
after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last
Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the
incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.

TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND,"The Tower Commission report, which
says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms
deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political
dominance in Washington, political analysts said.
    ""This is certification of incompetence,"" private political
analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower
report made public today.
    ""It's as if he went before a professional licensing board
and was denied credentials.""
    In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John
Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican
senator from Texas, told a press conference, ""The president
clearly did not understand the nature of this operation.""
    The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in
Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the
government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared
by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.
    The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism
from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.
    ""We're falling by our own hand,"" said one Republican
political strategist. ""What can we say except 'we're sorry, we
won't do it again'?""
    The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988
presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said
the report was like ""an anvil falling on us.""
    Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study
group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of
regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,
the press and the Washington bureaucracy.
    The report may also undermine the standing of Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George
Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping
their own skirts clean than supporting the president.
    ""They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences,"" it said.
    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central
Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong
criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.
    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged
for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran
initiative and to avoid ""chaos"" in the disclosure process.
    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health
reasons last month.
    ""This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of
being heroes,"" Tower told reporters.
    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,
including command of the armed forces and the right to veto
legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to
retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly
with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the
man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.
    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as
twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms
deal with Iran became public last November, his personal
popularity is still relatively high.
    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed
that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in
control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was
doing a good job as president.
    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a
Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power
brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.
    ""In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite
by appealing directly to the public,"" Schneider said.
    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised
address next week.
    But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting
a dramatic turnaround.
    ""The White House has to avoid building expectations that
cannot be met,"" said the strategist, who requested anonymity.
""They have to recognize there is no quick fix.""
    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity
has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's
elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control
of the Senate to the Democrats.

SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL,"Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    ""Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process,"" Cranston said.
    ""Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct,"" he told reporters. ""I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports.""
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    ""By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports,"" Cranston said.
    ""We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place,"" Evans told
reporters.

CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS,"ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste

    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    ""This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder,"" an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    ""This is totally by surprise,"" said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    ""I think they will resist it,"" said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. ""Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would.""
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY,"inflation
plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the
economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring
prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the
value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread
indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
pct inflation rate.
    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
    ""The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was
inflation, at least the economy worked,"" a leading bank
economist said.
    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a
dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and
1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to
cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr
foreign debt.
    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one
billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports
increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged
under 150 mln.

U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN,"A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy
in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.
    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.
    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a
primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
investment.
    ""It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
Wyss of Data Resources Inc. ""I'm particularly impressed by the
19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
tax reform than we thought.""
    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
office and computing equipment orders.
    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
    ""It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
people just aren't doing it as much,"" Wyss said.
     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
economists said.
    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
0.9 pct.
    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
by more than tax reform.
    ""The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
than the actual gains that took place in November and
December,"" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ""The
economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year.""
    ""The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
spending over the next couple of quarters,"" said Donald Maude
of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
    ""It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
may quickly translate to a drop in production,"" Midland
Montagu's Maude said.
    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
January's report, given that other reports have reflected
strength.
    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
December.
    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
    ""Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
tighten,"" Data Resources' Wyss said.
    ""But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
like this. The Fed will wait and see,"" he added.
    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. ""People
aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
have to ease to ensure global growth.""

ARGENTINA COULD SUSPEND DEBT PAYMENTS - DEPUTY,"Argentina could suspend payments on
its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr
loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party
Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station.
    ""Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the
negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth
of the country,"" he added.
    Baglini, an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New
York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks,
told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the
banks were divided on the loan request.
    Baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second day
of talks had been postponed.
    He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of
Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest
payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign
debt.
    Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was
to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in
1987, Baglini said.
    ""Debtor nations should not have to take from their own
pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest
payments,"" he added.

KEY U.S. TAX WRITERS SEEK ESTATE TAX CURBS,"The chairmen and senior Republican
members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed
legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to
an employee stock ownership plan.
    The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion
dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.
    If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions
after Sept 26, 1987.
    The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn),
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen
Bob Packwood (R-Ore).
    In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction
enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad
and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four
years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less
than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.
    He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which
allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a
statement, ""The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows
many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax
entirely when they die.""
    He added, ""The provision was intended to encourage estates
to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of
promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not
meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as
is currently estimated.""

QUEBECOR &lt;PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY,"Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest
publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new
daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president
Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.
    The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec
government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company &lt;Donohue
Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper
mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.
    ""I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This
is not definite but i think we will,"" he said, adding that he
plans to announce a decision early next week.
    Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last
year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily
newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the
second-largest circulation paper in Canada.
    A new daily would give Montreal its second English-
language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city
the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North
America, analysts have said.
    Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English
language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six
months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new
venture would have the support of major advertisers.
    Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55
pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of
two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project
but has not decided whether he would take partners in the
newspaper venture.
    He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one
of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.
    ""It would be the possibility of doing something else in the
short term,"" Peladeau said.
    Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert
Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc &lt;BPCL.L>
does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.
    Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake
in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the
govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British
printing acquiring the other 49 pct.
    ""In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of
newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to
print the paper,"" Peladeau said. ""When I lived that, I said to
myself...next time we'll be ready.""
    Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint
capacity however, is already committed to other buyers.
    Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year
and Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror
newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.
    Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49
pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's
540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will
have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build
another mill to meet their demands .
    He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or
other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be
on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed
area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the
government.
    Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures
with Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in
France or in the U.S., where the company owns two large
printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.
    He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would
provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are
prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would
consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in
France or the U.S.
    Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of
about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of
two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating
the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada,
Peladeau said.
    He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers
in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the
province.
    Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its
listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock
Exchange listing.

U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS,"U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.
    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week
statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February
25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve
projections in the week to Wednesday.
    He said that natural float had been ""acting a bit
strangely"" for this time of year, noting that there had been
poor weather during the latest week.
    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to
nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.
    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high
float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's
float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
two widely separated Fed districts.
    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
adjustments were ""small,"" adding that they fell to a negative
750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for
unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
country.
    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two
different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
2100 EST on both days.
    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during
both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
impact.
    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
institutions.
    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
15 pct by the smallest banks.
    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on
Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average
deficit for the week as a whole.
    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
the smallest banks.

AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF,"American Express Co remained silent on
market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
value of its stock.
    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
stock activity.
    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
yesterday of management changes.
    At the meeting, company officials said American Express
stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
of Shearson, according to analysts.
    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
spinoff.
    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
year.
    ""I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
going to sell shearson,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
He questioned what would be a better investment than ""a very
profitable securities firm.""
    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
asset.
    But others believe the company could very well of
considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
believes American Express could have considered a partial
spinoff in the past.
    ""Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
capitalization,"" said Eckenfelder.
    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
it plans to expand globally.
    ""They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
road,"" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
    ""They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
in the future, which goes heavily into the international
arena,"" said Lewis. ""...That does not preclude acquisitions and
divestitures along the way,"" he said.
    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
services business.
    ""It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
the total operating earnings of the company,"" he said.
     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

COLECO INDUSTRIES &lt;CLC> SEES PROFIT IN 1987,"Coleco Industries Inc said
it expects to return to profitability in 1987.
    Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for
the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln
dlrs in the year earlier.
    In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic
swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep
decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln
dlrs to 230 mln dlrs.
    Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a
more diversified organization through four major acquisitions
last year.
    Products from the new acquisitions and other new product
introductions are expected to enable it to return to
profitability, it said.
    At the annual Toy Fair earlier this month, vice president
Morton Handel said analysts' 1987 projected earnings of 90 cts
a share on sales of 600 mln dlrs are reasonable.

GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH,"A study on grain certificates due out
shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show
that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than
cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.
    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture
Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests
that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official
told Reuters.
    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific
request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the
senate agriculture committee.
    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates
compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.
    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on
the program's impact on the USDA loan program.
    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan
entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of
the program would go up. However, if it is determined that
certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to
decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.
    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates
program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.
    But a negative report on certificates ""will fuel the fire
against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase
in the certificate program,"" an agricultural consultant said.
    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,
while USDA remains firmly committed to it.

Venezuela seeks 'flexibility' from banks-azpurua,"venezuela is seeking a 'constructive and
flexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to
reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister
manuel azpurua told a press conference.
    He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york
between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's
13-bank advisory committee except to say, ""they are
progressing.""
    Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's
decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate
according to its own interest.
    Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors
today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over
libor, azpurua said only, ""that is good news.""
    According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to
venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last
february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct
Venezuela wants.
    Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with
the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments
due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment
schedule, and debt capitalization schemes.
    Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in
public and private debt principal this year. It was due to
amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420
mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector.
    He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no
principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting
that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank
loans.
    The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to
lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that
no direct commitment was likely on new loans.
    ""debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and
there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of
financing is guaranteed,"" azpurua said.
    However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan
proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt
payments, ""because circumstances change too quickly.""
    At the same time, he said the government is presently
studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private
sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries.
The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the
central bank.

OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS,"OPEC may be forced to meet before a
scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    ""The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    ""OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way,"" said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    ""OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. ""The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again,"" he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    ""They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens,"" Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.""
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    ""OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then,"" said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    ""Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production,"" he told Reuters in a
telephone interview.

BANKS EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN ON BRAZIL DEBT MOVES,"Brazil's 14-bank advisory committee
expressed ""grave concern"" to chief debt negotiator Antonio
Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest
payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank
to creditor banks worldwide.
    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger
and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move
last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs
of short-term trade and interbank lines.
    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign
debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank
executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee
vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,
told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to
explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.
    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,
bankers said.
    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans
for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial
bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.
    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.

LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987,"Liquefied natural gas imports from
Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its
economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.
    Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian
state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in
Algiers that such imports would be made this year.
    ""Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and
the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay
the import until 1988/1989,"" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas
analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.
    Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former
customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary
of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials
told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington
Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.
    Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were
feasible. ""On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have
made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate
profitably even in the current price environment,""  Frank
Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.
   Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports
on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend
higher by the end of 1987.
    A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of
Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm
prices, Shearson's Tulis said.
   In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of
supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.
    Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,
saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.
    Company sources also said that any negotiations with
Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate
volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market
values.

U.S. FARM CREDIT RESCUE BILL SEEN BEFORE EASTER,"The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm
credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its
regulator do not ask for help by then.
    ""We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you,
before the Easter recess,"" Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said.
    Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants
recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when
Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said.
    Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the
system's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid.
    Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA,
as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all
its capital and needs federal government help.
    However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the
system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action,
he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year
and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of
the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.
    But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify
aid is needed, it should request help informally.
    ""We all know we need a capital infusion,"" Boren said.
    Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the
plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent
Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council
representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the
system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining
after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.
    While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated
the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.
    ""A significant number of banks and associations in the most
economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer
extraordinary losses,"" Beesley said.
    Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said
the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some
one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay
loans.
    The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by
the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.
    FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds
in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor
suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.
    ""The bondholders have no worry at this time,"" Billington
said.
    Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit
system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation
of the system into a centralized national lender, to
de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.
    But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about
proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those
proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.
    Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside
the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said
a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent
could be developed without Congressional legislation.

REPORT COULD BE FINAL BLOW FOR REGAN,"The Tower Commission's scathing   
comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald
Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure,
but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top
officials was less clear.
    Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of
Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert
arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan
rebels first emerged last November.
    But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George
Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they
opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been
muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.
    ""Their obligation was to give the president their full
support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if
they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the
president,"" the report said after a three-month probe.
    ""Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program.
They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences of his personal commitment to
freeing the hostages.""
    The report saved some of its most scathing language for
Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal
friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House
angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more
importantly, Reagan's wife Nancy.
    ""More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he
asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought
to extend this control to the national security adviser,"" said
the report.
    Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to
be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to
announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower
Commission's findings next week.
    With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter
and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the
report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn
the spotlight on their future.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally,
told reporters the report disclosed ""colossal blunders"" and said
people who had not served the president well should step aside,
but he did not specify who should go.
    ""It would seem to me that if you don't protect the
president, you don't serve the president well, then you should
move on,"" the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate
next year, said.
    One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not
be the only White House official to leave in the near future.

    The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out
some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in
inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.
    The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product
growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986
and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after
last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.
    But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest
increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate
unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial
nation OECD area.
    Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to
the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,
the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct
rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct
respectively in 1986.
    The faster growth of imports compared with exports this
year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant
that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP
would shrink in both years.
    But ""given Switzerland's large external surplus, there
should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than
GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to
improving international balances,"" the OECD said.
    Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually
buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several
years of relative weakness, it noted.
    In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat
to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall
GDP, it added.
    The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained
bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels
last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation
in both the industry and service sectors, it said.
    As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment
investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year
after vigorous growth in 1986.
    But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for
tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector
earners of foreign exchange.
    The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the
accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could
lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.
    Particularly for the banks, ""recent developments in
international financial markets give rise to the question
whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial
flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed
required ... To preserve its competitive position,"" it said.

U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT,"The U.S. Agriculture Department is not
actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
officials said.
    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
the very near future.
    ""The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,""
an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. ""But there
just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.""
    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
this week.
    But administration and private sources agreed that if the
Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
Moscow, it could take several months.
    ""I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
interagency process,"" the aide to Lyng said.
    ""An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,""
said one former USDA official, who noted that the
administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
China wheat under the subsidy program.
    An official representing a large grain trade company said
deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
subsidy offer to the Soviets.
    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
consultations this week described them as an exchange of ""calm,
basic, factual economics.""
    Another USDA official said there was ""not even an informal
suggestion or hint"" that the Soviets would live up to their
pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
granted more favorable terms.
    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
from the Iran arms affair.

U.S. TREASURY PART OF ARGENTINE BRIDGE LOAN,"The U.S. Treasury said it was willing
to participate with several other industrial countries in
providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina.
    The Treasury announcecement did not name the other
countries nor the amount of financing the United States was
willing to supply.
    Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday
night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15
billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.
    ""Our willingness to participate in this multilateral
short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina's
economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable
balance of payments position,"" the Treassury statement said.
    In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentine
officials said the country needed ""a more serene climate"" to
carry out structural changes in the economy.
    But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its
foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week.
    The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for
Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.
    The one-page statement noted the International Monetary
Fund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies and
prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for
it on February 18.
    ""Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF
balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to
repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation
of its economic program,"" the statement said.
    The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less
than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze
to restrain inflation.
    The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine
Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for
several days.
    Along with new financing, Argentina reportedly wants lower
interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign
debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of
the money is loaned in Argentina.

BANKS EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN ON BRAZIL DEBT MOVE,"Brazil's 14-bank advisory committee
expressed ""grave concern"" to chief debt negotiator Antonio
Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest
payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank
to creditor banks worldwide.
    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger
and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move
last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs
of short-term trade and interbank lines.
    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign
debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank
executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee
vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,
told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to
explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.
    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,
bankers said.
    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans
for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial
bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.
    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.

JURY FINDS FOR DOW &lt;DOW> IN BIRTH DEFECT CASE,"Dow Chemical Co's &lt;DOW> Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc unit said a jury found that Bendectin did
not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose
mother took the drug during pregnancy.
    The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning 
sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the
drug caused birth defects.
    Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials
involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany.
    It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were
obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about
1,150 plaintiffs.
    In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the
plaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled the
jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company
and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the
trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of
this case by the full Court of Appeals.
    Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and in
the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
    At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging
the drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. He
said about 300 lawsuits are pending.
    Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s, and the
Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market
the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the
company decide it wants to reintroduce it.

AGENCY VOTES TO END LOCAL NUCLEAR PLANT VETO,"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants,
which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial
plants in New York and New Hampshire.
    The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public
comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation
standards of its own.
    Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island,
N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in
evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.
    They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe
evacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue full
power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants.
    A group of prominent politicians, led by New York Governor
Mario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan
on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting
the utilties'investments than protecting public safety.
    An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had
not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan.

said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in

FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT,"The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios
seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has
pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean
processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean
meal and oil.
    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the
National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78
mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over
the past two months when crush margins surged to the best
levels seen in over a year.
    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed
soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the
weekly crush number.
    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,
with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge
in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next
few months.
    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed
demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder
than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in
an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.
    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent
weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the
nearby March contract today.
    ""Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold
May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,
which would cause March to gain on deferreds),"" one CBT crush
trader said.
    ""But they've been bailing out this week because the March
has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not
tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added.
    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush
ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)
fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per
bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two
days.
    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no
processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable
level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut
back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.
    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid
premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.
    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents
for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down
sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below
the average cost of production, cash dealers said.
    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with
little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But
processors will start halting production in the next few weeks
it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.

FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY,"Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that
the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of
pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making
meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.
    ""The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we
can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had
changed,"" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.
    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee
last Thursday that the Fed's policy ""has been unchanged up to
today.""
    Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most
fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on
reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted
confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered
the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
    This need for additional reassurance was made all the more
acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from
the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase
agreements for the first time since April of last year,
economists added.
    Today's data showed that the draining action was for a
fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.
    ""The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively
sizeable matched sales on Wednesday,"" said Dana Johnson of
First National Bank of Chicago. ""But there was a clearly
justified need for them. There was nothing ominous.""
    ""The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new
statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its
(reserve) projections,"" added Security Pacific's Bannon.
    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large
single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.
    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-
expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount
window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,
compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.
    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the
daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from
160 in the prior period.
    ""There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and
Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings,"" said
Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday
average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.
    Lending further support to the stable policy view was a
relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the
latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in
the banking system, economists said.
    ""For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,
with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,"" said Darwin Beck of
First Boston Corp. ""I expect it to continue in that vein.""
    ""Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion
dlrs,"" added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves
averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement
period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.
    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range
to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little
attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion
dlr jump in the week ended February 16.
    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a
fine line between the dollar's progress in the international
currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.
    ""The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on
Fed policy,"" said First Chicago's Johnson. ""Of course, it will
take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if
the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing.""

JAPAN TO TRY TO OPEN MARKET TO U.S. CAR PARTS,"Japan has pledged to try to increase
its purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to
monitor the purchases, the Commerce Department said.
    U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese
officials to try to force open the Japanese market to
American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five
billion dlr deficit in car parts trade.
    Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made
parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts
for parts purchases, a Commerce department official said.
    He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try
to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to
monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders.
    The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that
""statistics support the perception in the United States that
American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner
circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional
suppliers.""
    It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five
billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985, U.S.
firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market.

FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES,"France's right wing government is facing
growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising
down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation
forecasts for this year.
    Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector
forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation
estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its
economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a
2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last
september.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures
would not push the government off its chosen mix of price
deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.
    But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would
push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising
the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.
    And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed
Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth
and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,
perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential
elections due by April 1988.
    ""The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,""
said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. ""We have the
impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth
this year.""
    ""The big question is whether the government's policy of wage
moderation will be maintained,"" he added.
    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout
1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises
justified by increased productivity.
    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond
Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already
rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built
into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher
prices.
    Calling the government's policies ""unbalanced and unjust,"" he
also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He
announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the
government would spend two billion francs on a series of
measures to boost employment and training
    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate
Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac
earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of
France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings
its top priority.
    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and
still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts
said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.
    ""Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist
government and I dont think this administration is going to
reverse that,"" commented Michel Develle, economist at
recently-privatised Banque Paribas.
    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas
and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher
inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he
said.
    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more
than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7
per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.
    ""But that would still be an exceptional achievement
considering that for the first time since the Second World War
all french prices have been freed,"" he commented.
    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments
abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible
for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living
costs.
    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should
have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.
    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long
as the government kept wages under control.
    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of
1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more
than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,
INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,
he added.
    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to
help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget
deficit, several analysts said.
    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value
Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a
loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than
expected growth, they said.

ITALIAN COALITION MEETS AS GOVERNMENT CRISIS LOOMS,"Leaders of Italy's five coalition parties
have agreed to meet today to try to settle their differences
which are mainly between Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's
Socialist Party and the majority Christian Democrats.
    Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani said
Craxi told him he would announce his resignation next week,
allowing negotiations on a new government leader.
    The conservative Christian Democrats demanded the meeting
after Craxi said a pact agreed during a government crisis last
August, under which he was to hand over the prime minister's
job next month, was unlikely to be fulfilled.
    Political sources said the Christian Democrats are likely
to leave the coalition, which also includes Republicans, Social
Democrats and Liberals, unless they get the prime minister's
job. They said Craxi's plans to resign show he has decided to
stick to the pact but talks on a leader, a government program
and sharing of ministries will not be easy.
    They said there is dissent among the partners and that
Forlani has been trying to mediate to avoid a crisis. They said
the five are likely to begin talks tomorrow on whether
formation of a new government is feasible or early elections
are inevitable. Elections are not due until 1988.

"N.Z. CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH","Monetary and credit growth rates in
New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels
following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late
last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.
    The monetary and credit growth figures for the December
quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high
growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short
term money market, Russell said in a statement.
    The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs
of the recent expansion became apparent in September and
October last year, Russell said.
    Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of
17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in
the year ended September.
    Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was
30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.
    ""Available evidence suggests that corporate customers,
including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN EYEING FOREIGN STOCKS,"Japanese life insurers, trust banks and
corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond
market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the
U.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said.
    After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years,
Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on
similar types of investments, they said.
    Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may
double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in
1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said.
    Matsumoto, who manages Nikko's investment research and
strategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors began
poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year,
but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases
suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each
of the previous five months.
    Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added.
    This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw
the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct
of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said.
    ""The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, first
because of its size and next because it has been successful
over the last couple of years,"" said Eugene Atkinson, managing
director of Goldman Sachs International Corp.
    Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity,
enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in
and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added.
    However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling.
They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said.
    Institutions, particularly life insurance companies which
concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover
payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S.
Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse,
manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed
income activities.
    There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term
investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a
significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the
liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added.
    Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S.
Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S.
Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months.
    Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports
of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations,
he added.
    Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance
Co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which
are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign
securities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and
intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies.
    Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their
funds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West
Germany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said.
    Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks
relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the
strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to
offset currency risks, he added.
    One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct
annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in
U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund
investment stategies.
    The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European
bonds, he said.
    Japanese investments in British equities have already
turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew
Sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at
County Securities Japan.
    ""Last week was the busiest week we had,"" he said.
    Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of
British companies and the recent deregulation of government
controlled firms, fund managers said.
    Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese
interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by
worries about the French franc, they said.
    Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and
speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term
political stability, they added.
    Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany,
particularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts,
are concerned about the recent dollar fall.
    Australia also poses some risks due to currency values,
they added.

JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES,"Japan is expected to cut the base lending
rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    The bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
the ministry sources said.
    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

AUSTRALIA'S KEATING CHANGES ECONOMIC FORECASTS,"Domestic demand is now expected to make
no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal
1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all
of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.
    However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic
Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise
in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.
    But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this
financial year and net export growth will provide the total
source of gdp growth.
    The August budget had forecast domestic demand would
contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5
pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.
    Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic
parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a
slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit
than first anticipated.
    ""The government initially forecast a current account deficit
for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that
the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,"" he said.
    Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC
in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is
broadly on track, Keating said.
    ""They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more
sluggish than was expected at budget time,"" he said.
    ""On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more
than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth
in domestic production and employment.""
    Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation
rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.
    ""Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in
inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary
effects wane,"" he said.
    Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick
up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in
net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from
private domestic demand.
    He said domestic demand growth will be due to a
strengthening in real household disposable income.
    The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year
should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level
broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.
    ""The current account deficit will continue to show
improvement in 1987/88,"" Keating said.
    ""As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent
years recede further, and given continued effective wage
restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,"" he
said.

MANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS,"The Philippines will offer its commercial
bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt
payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative
to cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the
alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt
rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.
    He did not give details but said, ""It is a very useful
alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that
they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the
Philippines to say exactly the same thing.""
    Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the
country""s 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt
certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.
    It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon
bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a
considerable discount from their redemption price.
    It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a
guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no
payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.
    It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond
market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.

PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS,"Talks on the possibility of reintroducing
global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with
sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was
not included in a key negotiating forum.
    The special meeting of the International Coffee
Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a
prolonged slide in coffee prices.
    However, delegates said no solution to the question of how
to implement quotas was yet in sight.
    World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to
regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement
-- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to
a drought which cut Brazil""s output by nearly two thirds.
    Brazil is the world""s largest coffee producer and exporter.
    Producers and consumers now are facing off over the
question of how quotas should be calculated under any future
quota distribution scheme, delegates said.
    Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight
producing countries was not represented in a contact group of
five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which
was set up to facilitate debate.
    The big producers ""want to have the ball only in their court
and it isn""t fair,"" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of
Costa Rica said.
    The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas
April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota
shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before
September 30, delegates said.
    Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil
to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export
market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia
six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.
    But consuming countries and the dissident producer group
have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined
by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable
production and stocks statistics.
    Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and
Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota
distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.
    Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal
that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.
    Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on
a quota package. ""Anything is possible at this phase,"" even
adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.
    If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the
supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a
result, industry sources said.
    Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about
steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an
upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,

BRITISH CONSERVATIVES AHEAD OF LABOUR IN NEW POLLS,"Britain""s ruling Conservatives have
enlarged their lead over the opposition Labour Party, according
to results of two opinion polls released on Saturday.
    A Market &amp; Opinion Research International (MORI) poll
conducted for The Sunday Times showed the Conservatives with a
six point lead, while a poll by Telephone Surveys Limited for
The Sunday Express found them to be four points ahead.
    The Sunday Express poll is the first conducted since the
Social Democratic Party scored an upset victory on Thursday in
a parliamentary by-election in the former Labour stronghold of
Greenwich, near London.
    The MORI poll, conducted in the six days leading up to the
by-election, showed the Conservatives with 41 pct of the vote,
Labour with 35 pct and the Alliance of Social Democrats and
Liberals with 21 pct.
    The Sunday Express said its poll, conducted on Friday,
found the Conservatives ahead with 35.6 pct of the vote, Labour
with 31.9 pct and the Alliance with 31.4 pct.
    A Harris poll published in The Observer newspaper last
Sunday gave the Conservatives only a two-point lead over
Labour. In that survey, the Conservatives had the support of 39
pct of the voters, Labour 37 pct and the Alliance 23 pct.

INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW,"Indonesia""s agriculture sector will grow
by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
    Production of Indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast to
fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
Indonesia""s agricultural performance.
    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
1987.
    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
a drawdown on stocks.
    ""Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
gain,"" the report says.
    ""The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
and palm kernels.""
    Constraints to significant overall increases in
agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
report underlines.
    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
largely offset gains in yields.
    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
resistant rice types.
    The government is depending on increased production of
export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
oil prices.
    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
report says.
    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
September""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
in domestic demand.
    The report said that Indonesia""s overall economic
performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
in 1984.
    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
for the slump.

KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS,"Kuwait""s Oil Minister, in remarks
published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
oil prices.
    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
daily al-Qabas as saying: ""None of the OPEC members has asked
for such a meeting.""
    He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
limits of the 13-nation organisation.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
bpd agreed in Geneva last December.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
    ""This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said
Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that
because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,"" the minister
said.
    Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to
produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
    ""If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,"" he said.
    He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,
which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker
of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels
this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
19 dollars a barrel.
    Sheikh Ali also delivered ""a challenge to any international
oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.""
    Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
    However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
of its local and international refining facilities and its own
distribution network abroad, he added.
    He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC""s
differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
April at the request of certain of the body""s members.
    Ecuador""s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said
last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign
a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
talks this month of opec""s pricing committee.
    Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in
apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: ""We
expected such pressure. It will continue through March and
April."" But he expected the situation would later improve.

INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE,"Indonesia appears to be nearing a
political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
    To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
investment.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""s
fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
currency by 31 pct in September.
    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto""s
government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
the economy.
    ""(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,""
the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia""s agricultural
sector, but also reviews the country""s general economic
performance.
    It says that while many government officials and advisers
are recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strong
pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.""
    ""This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,""
the report says.
    Indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
    Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
restrictions and liberalised imports.
    The report says Indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986
was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
contracted a bit. ""This is the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s,"" the report notes.
    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
April.
    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
in the economic outlook. ""For 1987 early indications point to a
slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
earnings from the petroleum industry.""
    ""Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
growth in agriculture,"" the report states.
    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
crucial for the government to get the international lending its
needs.
    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
of payments support was given partly to help the government
maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

INDIAN BUDGET COMES IN FOR WIDE CRITICISM,"Opposition politicians, businessmen
and newspapers criticised India""s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget
and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees.
    They said the budget failed to provide incentives for
economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform.
    But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise
in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where
playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a
vote winner. The Indian Express, the country""s biggest selling
paper, said: ""The defence cow has never been holier.""
    The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget ""shamelessly
political."" It said in a front page commentary the ""budget is bad
for growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market and
neutral in respect of everything else.""
    Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done
little for them.
    Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and
education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current
expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He
told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of
money-losing public sector industries.
    Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but
otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation
policy launched two years ago.
    Reaction in Bombay, India""s business capital, was generally
unfavourable.
    Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals
for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost
industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real
economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the
1985-90 development plan.
    Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambers
of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital
market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove
surtax on corporate income.
    Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India""s biggest, fell
in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi""s
proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities
industry.
    The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and
trading was suspended several times.
    Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in
capital gains tax on stock sales.
    Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of
three years without incurring capital gains tax.
    Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the
fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were
taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come.

QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88,"The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
    The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
in the last published budget for 1985/86.
    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
billion riyals.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
pct.
    He urged heads of government departments and public
institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
the country's foreign reserves.
    He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
allocated for major projects including housing and public
buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
communications, electricity and water, industry and
agriculture.
    No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
    Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
barrels per day.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: ""Our expectations of positive signs

"GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS","Gulf money markets have grown reasonably
well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain
to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf
International Bank BSC> (GIB) said.
    The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf
capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional
investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank
accounts and precious metals.
    ""Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with
more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the
disclosure requirements on company accounts,"" he said.
    The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three
categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.
    Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of
short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had
floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.
    ""Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large
extent, fragmented and lagging behind,"" he said.
    Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans
and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of
stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock
exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish
exchanges.
    But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,
governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital
markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.
    He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had
""clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital
markets in the region.""
    In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,
financial awareness among investors is still lacking and
investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack
depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted
investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.
    Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some
Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt
financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.
    He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation
of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.
    Azzam said capital market instruments should be made
available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been
taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to
own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.
    Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth
from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and
the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi
Arabia.
    But he added there is ""no bond market to speak of"" in Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal
denominated bond issued in 1978.
    While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading
in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal
exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,
Azzam said.

SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT,"Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC
accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the
official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.
    Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia ""is fully adhering by the
... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
pronounced prices under any circumstance.""
    Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market
prices ""may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)
winter season and the glut in the market.""
    Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,
under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by
7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,
which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in
mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices
are currently just over 16 dlrs.
    Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's
adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.
    He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all
wanted to stick to the accord.
    In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also
Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the
pricing agreement.
    ""We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate
the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the
fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,"" he said.
    Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said
in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were
no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.

"COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, NO ACCORD SEEN LIKELY","The International Coffee Organization
(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued
with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but
delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and
consumers were diminishing by the minute.
    The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in
coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without
agreement, delegates said.
    The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within
the next six weeks or in September, they said.

apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the
formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates

FEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS,"The U.S. Economy continued to expand in
February but at a slower pace than in January, which saw a
spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) said in a report.
    The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9
pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    But production remained vigorous, with more than three
times as many members reporting it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually
resumed production.
    The same number of members reported inventories were higher
as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened
since August 1984.
    For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying
higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine
to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee, said: ""The economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter.""
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

"ZAMBIA TO RETAIN CURRENCY AUCTION, SAYS KAUNDA","Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange
auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since
January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.
    ""We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been
abolished at all,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
    He said the system would be reintroduced after current
talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.
    Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction
system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private
bidders but not to fix the exchange rate.
    Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the
government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.
    It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and
strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible
for the government and the private sector, he said.
    Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The
kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.
In January 1987 the government was more than two months in
arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and
the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange
rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

EC MINISTERS CONSIDER BIG AGRICULTURE PRICE CUTS,"European Community (EC) agriculture
ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts
in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests
by European farmers, Community officials said.
    The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's
Brussels Commission, which for the fourth year running has
called for radical changes in the price support system.
    EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food
surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners
and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such
action.
    With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes
of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge
stocks of wine and olive oil, Andriessen says bluntly the days
of open-ended price guarantees must end.
    EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices
paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the
new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as EC
members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline.
    Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled
with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead
to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products.
    A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed
guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be
scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases.
    The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on
agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow
two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European
currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected
shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus.
    The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils
and fats tax and a change in the ""green"" exchange rate system,
which translates EC farm prices into national currencies.
    The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied on
imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger
a fresh trade dispute with the United States, which provides
the EC with the bulk of its soybeans.
    It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat
products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter
consumption.
    West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which
would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with
weak and strong currencies were brought more into line.

QANTAS TO BUY FOUR 747-400'S FOR ONE BILLION DLRS,"&lt;Qantas Airways Ltd> has placed a firm
order with Boeing Co &lt;BA> for four 747-400 aircraft at a cost
of 250 mln Australian dlrs each, chairman Jim Leslie said.
    The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others
arriving in May, June and September of that year, he said in a
statement.
    The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747
family, he said.
    The purchase will take government-owned Qantas's 747 fleet
to 28, he said.
    Leslie said Qantas is talking to three engine makers who
are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will
announce a decision on engine purchases later this year.
    He said they are United Technologies Corp &lt;UTX> unit &lt;Pratt^M
and Whitney>, General Electric Co &lt;GE> and Britain's &lt;Rolls-Royce^M
 Ltd>.
    He said the 747-400, which incorporates new technology such
as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced
electronics, should have its first flight next February. The
400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, 2,140 kms
further than the current Qantas 747-300's, he said.
    The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and
foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay
for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said.
    The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up
from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel
saving, he said.
    The higher range and payload means they will first be used
on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia.
    They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney
and Los Angeles.

STRONG EARTHQUAKE HITS NEW ZEALAND,"An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the
Richter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand
and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas,
officials and seismologists said.
    There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake
jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas.
    The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually
isolated.
    A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which
has about 16,000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges
in the area had been damaged.
    No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to
hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud
slip.
    Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes,
the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were
followed by a series of aftershocks.
    The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato
regions in the northeast of the North Island.
    Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more
than a week.
    Police said many districts lost power supplies and
telephone links.
    Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water
behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam, 32 kilometres above
Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river. The quake cracked the
roadway and concrete abutment along the top of Matahina, the
largest earth dam in the North Island.

PHILIPPINES HEADS CONFIDENTLY INTO DEBT TALKS,"Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin
starts negotiations with the country's 12-bank advisory
committee in New York tomorrow, buoyed by an economy on the
mend and political stability one year after President Corazon
Aquino took power, central bank officials said.
    The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion
dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between
January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on
another 5.8 billion dlrs, rescheduled in a 1985 accord, to any
new agreement, the officials said.
    Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage
point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and
Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR
portend well for the Philippines, despite Brazil's repayment
suspension last week, the officials said.
    Manila, which has not made any principal repayments since
1983, wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16
percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a
77 billion dlr rescue.
    Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which is
currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct.
    The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered
when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7.
    Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional
5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments.
    One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-type
accord, which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusing
to endorse five months after it was signed.
    In Manila's case, about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrs
outstanding to commercial banks is owed to the 12 large banks
on the advisory committee, while about 180 smaller banks have
average exposures of 20 mln dlrs each.

SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD,"Saudi crude oil output last month fell
to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
in January, Gulf oil sources said.
    They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah
terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
customers.
    But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd
from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
    The production figures include neutral zone output but not
sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
part of a country's output for Opec purposes.
    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
a barrel.
    The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
entitlements before the month-end.
    Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude
customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.
    The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc
&lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement
last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
    However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's
ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
come this month, when demand for petroleum products
traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent
weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.
    Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord
and said it would never sell below official prices.
    The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
refineries.
    They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd
last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at
Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
at around 200,000 bpd each.

INDONESIAN PALM OIL OUTPUT EXPECTED TO RISE,"Indonesia's palm oil output is expected
to rise and exports to increase, the U.S. Embassy said in its
annual report on Indonesia's agriculture sector.
    The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output
is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in
1988, up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln
in 1985.
    The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a
provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes.
    A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln
tonnes, against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985.
    ""More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will
be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes,"" the report said.
    The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export
tax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher
international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase
in exports this year.
    Exports are forecast to rise to 720,000 tonnes against

"INDONESIAN TEA, COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP, COFFEE DOWN","Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa
will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are
forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the
government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said.
    The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture
forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60
kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags
produced in 1985/86.
    In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to
5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln
in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags.
    The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln
tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a
fall in exports as a result of the ""probable"" re-introduction of
quotas by the International Coffee Organisation.
    Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily
as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of
cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985
from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government
to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.
    Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000
tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.
    The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes
this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.
    The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of
Indonesian cocoa beans.
    The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC
(crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase
significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new
CTC processing plants.
    Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing
more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.
    Production of black and green teas is forecast in the
embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from
123,000 tonnes in 1986.
    Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes
in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.

SINGAPORE EXCHANGE SEEKING NASDAQ/LONDON LINK,"The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES)
plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on London's Stock Exchange
Automated Quotation System, banking sources said.
    The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York
authorities. Gordon Macklin, president of the National
Association of Securities Dealers in Washington, said he was
very optimistic about an early agreement, possibly by the end
of this month.
    Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters
they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems
on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local
financial support for the plan existed.
    Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the
three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with Singapore filling
a gap when no trading takes place.
    A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start
of three-centre trading to determine investor interest.
    The Singapore, London and New York authorities have agreed
in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and
transfer information among the different time zones, but some
details still have to be worked out, a senior Singapore bank
director said.
    Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy
sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market
liquidity and communication links to the other three centres.
    But if agreement is reached, Singapore will have a head
start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong,
Toyko and Australia, he said.
    On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of
Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ),
modelled on NASDAQ.
    At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one
company, the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd
(SNP), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small
firms have said they plan to seek listings soon.
    Market sources expect the next few companies listed will
also be government-owned entities, which would have no problem
meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of
Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon, they said.
    SNP, previously wholly-owned by the government's Temasek
Holdings (Pte) Ltd, issued seven mln 50-cent shares at one dlr
each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times.
    In SESDAQ trading, SNP shares have advanced from an initial
1.87 dlrs to a Friday close of 2.32 after a 2.80 high. So far
more than 900,000 shares have traded.

GERMAN EUROBOND MARKET EXPECTS BREATHING SPACE,"After an onslaught of new paper, fewer
mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said.
    Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume
for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.
    ""We want to have a week's pause,"" one manager said.
    Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks,
including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank.
Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks,
from 3.6 billion in January.
    The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very
best addresses were having to accept higher coupons.
    ""I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you
can give a good coupon,"" another manager said.
    But even some government borrowers were not getting the
best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more
readily under other conditions.
    Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone,
bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees
on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows.
    Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday
at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2
pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price.
    A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees
at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price.
    Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the
10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for
Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks
mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.
    The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last
two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain
about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which
they say is too inflexible.
    Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be
registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the
two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on
the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the
next calendar period to schedule the bond again.
    Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.
    The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks
from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be
completely abolished. ""I don't think the Bundesbank would give
that up,"" one banking analyst said.
    ""I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,""
the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the
volume of new issues themselves.
    The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar
without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the
registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through
the euromarket, he said.
    For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank
sacrificing its present calendar system.
    Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication
departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to
the carnival holiday.
    Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday.
In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon.

IRAQ DEFERS PAYMENTS ON 500 MLN DLR EUROLOAN,"Iraq has secured agreement to defer
outstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloan
following five months of negotiations with creditor banks.
    Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of Iraq's
continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as its
economy comes under strain from the  Gulf War and soft world
oil prices.
    Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate last
September it could not meet the remaining four principal
repayments totalling 285 mln dlrs, and missed the first of
these for 71.25 mln due on September 29.
    The 500 mln dlr credit, under the lead management of
Paris-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF), has a
five-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point over
London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
    Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes some
way to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of the
first missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and not
deferred.
    One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature of
the accord, expected in late March, with the remainder in three
more instalments to be made every six months.
    The remaining three principal instalments - originally due
in March 1987, September 1987 and March 1988 - will each be
deferred for two years from the due date, banking sources said.
    The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penalty
interest is being imposed, the sources added.
    Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been one
of resignation, with many bankers seeing little alternative for
Baghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreign
debt of about 50 billion dlrs, although about half is thought
to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies,
particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
    The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned
Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit, a 500 mln dlr
deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank, was signed in
October, 1985 and is still in a two year grace period.
    The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by its
allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing.
    But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of
credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and
western government export credit agencies has been underway.
Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of
obligations due on letters of credit.

JAPAN PLANS MORE FLEXIBLE CORPORATE BOND ISSUES,"Japanese securities houses will issue new
corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout
the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive
underwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms back
to the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said.
    Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more
companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but
the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of
public bond issues, they said.
    ""Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only
to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and
warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas
markets,"" a Nikko Securities house bond manager said.
    Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after
a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now,
the securities managers said.
    Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance
system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end,
and accept issue requests during the month, they said.
    Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition
among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in
order to better reflect the market, securities managers said.
    Market participants expect the new issue methods to be
applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by &lt;Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp>.
    The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of
taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented
decisions on terms, securities sources said.
    The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns
underwriting corporate bonds.
    Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by
securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest
public bonds is now almost automatic, they said.
    The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in
late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond
market, securities house managers said.
    The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities
houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for
companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and
convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said.
    The cut will more than double the number of corporations
able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight
bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.
    The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange
Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration
system, more use of corporate ratings systems and
simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing
process, securities sources said.
    It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank
system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and
for deregulation of private placements, they said.
    Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put
into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system
would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in
1988, the sources said.

WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE,"Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back
a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the
companies at the core of their business empire.
    A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
    Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which
Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
    Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
the free shares.
    The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
    The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
    The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
    The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
&lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
&lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.
    Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and
Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
    Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>.
    During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
any raid on the heart of their business empire.
    But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small
at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
interests to protect its core activities.

INDONESIAN SOYBEAN IMPORTS FORECAST TO RISE,"Soybean imports are forecast to rise to
425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated
300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassy
said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture.
    It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of
self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it
did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because
yields have remained below target.
    Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000
tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000
tonnes in 1985/86.
    Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to
1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and
890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.
    Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to
rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to
come on stream in early 1988.
    China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the
U.S. Provides the rest, it said.
    ""This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since
domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are
willing to pay a premium for them,"" it said.
    Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both
1986/87 and 1987/88.
    ""Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient
supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,""
the report said.

JAPANESE BANKS COOL ON NIGERIAN DEBT TALKS,"Japanese banks are expected to give
Nigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here
tomorrow for talks, banking sources said.
    ""We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt
rescheduling,"" said a senior official at a leading Japanese
bank.
    A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese
creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support
for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr
foreign debt, bankers said.
    The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank
creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria
although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept
rescheduling of part of their existing loans.
    ""The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese
creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the
nation's debt situation,"" said another Japanese bank official.
    He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent
of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were
uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details.
    Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria,
representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western
commercial institutions, banking sources said.
    They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs
in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5
billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. Japanese
banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as
well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day
meeting here, the sources added.
    ""Otherwise, our response will be very negative,"" the senior
official said.
    Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor
banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt
proposal.
    Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial
banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems.

JAPAN SALES TAX MAY FORCE NAKASONE OUT OF OFFICE,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely
to leave office this summer amid opposition to his
controversial tax-reform package, political analysts said.
    They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has
suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct
sales tax planned for January 1988.
    ""Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the
end of his administration, which is not only impossible but
also is very irresponsible as a politican,"" Rei Shiratori,
professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters.
    ""Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as
parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,""
Shiratori said.
    Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of
parliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says is
needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes.
    Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP
members who oppose the tax. ""There are some who are objecting
because of their constituencies,"" he told a meeting of
government and party leaders. ""If the party discipline is
broken, I would like to see punishment considered.""
    ""A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly
because Nakasone breached his election pledge against
introducing it,"" Shiratori said.
    ""Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels
uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's
appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is
rapidly aging,"" he said.
    Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect
the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April,
involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and
assemblies at all levels.
    But the situation is complicated, since opposition parties
excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with
the LDP, the political analysts added.
    Shiratori said, ""In the worst case, implementation of the
sales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off for
some time before the government makes a final decision.
    ""Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to
perhaps three pct.
    ""A third alternative for the government is to ram through
the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs,"" he said.
    Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University,
thought the last possibility most likely. ""I think the LDP alone
will take a vote on the tax bills,"" he said.
    The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and
143 in the 252-seat Upper House.
    To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP
pushes through the tax bills, the Nakasone cabinet will have to
resign, Sato said.
    ""Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to
return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed,"" he said.

BLACK MINERS SUPPORT S. AFRICAN MINES TAKEOVER,"Thousands of black
mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize

    Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more
than half of the labour force in the mines.
    It was not stated how the union would ""seize control.""
    The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of
single sex hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by
housing schemes so that workers could live with their families.
    The crowd, one of the largest to attend a meeting since
South Africa declared a state of emergency last June, also

tonne overall quota that Thailand obtained from the EC for

ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS,"Mine and industry officials from
most member states of the Association of Tin Producing
Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group
exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according
to views polled by Reuter correspondents.
    The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at
cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and
boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.
    Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account
for some 65 pct of the world's tin output.
    Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export
quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000,
Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.
    Australia has said it is not setting any export quota.
However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly
equal to its expected output this year.
    Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.
    Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer,
said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that
output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started
March 1.
    Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that
excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in
the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.
    Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb
and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More
than 100 applications for licences are pending.
    Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining
licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed
that local mines were not overproducing.
    ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister
Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb.
    A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT
Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to
stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was
close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.
    In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said
Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this
would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.
    To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin
exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage
bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be
permitted, he said.
    The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to
disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive
production, industry sources said.
    But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told
Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo,
Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.
    Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in
1985, Pramual said.
    Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than
its allocated 13,761 tonne quota.
    Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz
that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in
calendar 1987.
    He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of
October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state
mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of
Bolivia's total exports.
    He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports
but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be
achieved. He did not elaborate.
    Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in
Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its
ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had
declined due to poor demand and high production costs.
    Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was
less than 1,000 tonnes last year.
    ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries'
export figures every three months using customs documents and
make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to
be breached within the year-long quota period.
    The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to
breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.
    They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil
their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other
members at the ATPC's discretion.
    The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated
106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.
    Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with
the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes
respectively during the quota period.

SAN MIGUEL BOARD APPOINTMENT MAY MEAN CHANGES,"Disagreement over management of &lt;San
Miguel Corp> (SMC) may follow the Philippine government's
appointment of a well-known banker to the SMC board, investment
analysts said.
    They told Reuters the presence of &lt;United Coconut Planters
Bank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may mean
changes in SMC management, which for decades was controlled by
the family of its president, Andres Soriano.
    Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls
51 pct of San Miguel's stock, after another nominee resigned.
    The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holds
six seats on the 15-member SMC board, which represent 33.13 mln
sequestered shares.
    The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by
Eduardo Cojuangco, then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He was
a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos, and he
left the country after Marcos's fall.
    Before the seizure, Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for
the shares, paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit.
    The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. They traded
at 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at Friday's close.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturday
that Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite the
objections of some directors associated with Soriano.
    ""I don't think there is a conflict of interest as such,"" he
said.
    ""I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where
you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy has
assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a
contentious manner,"" Ongpin added.
    The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing
Sy's directorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG that
a pending suit seeking forfeiture of SMC's 500 mln peso deposit
and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a
clear conflict.
    UCPB, however, sought board representation before Sy's
appointment, petitioning the PCGG ""so that the interests of the
owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected.""
    Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had a
right to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmers
who claim ownership of the disputed shares.
    The analysts said Sy, backed by the government, would
probably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected to
resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government
officials from working for private companies. SMC's annual
election is scheduled for May.
    A UCPB spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up to
the PCGG to decide whom to appoint.
    One analyst said objections were understandable from the
family that founded the company 97 years ago.
    ""It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano,""
he said.
    SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net
sales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on sales
of 10.36 billion.

ESTIMATED DROP IN JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS TRIMMED,"The combined profits of Japan's major
corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to
fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to
the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research
Institute of Economics said.
    The private research body also said in a statement that 437
of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year
against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November.
    Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on
sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said.
    Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries
to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten
their business outlook, the institute said.
    It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce
corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved
performance outlook.
    Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will
be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction
businesses, it said.
    The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates
of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88.

INDIAN BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN FUELING INFLATION,"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal
1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit
will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the
country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty,
economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters.
    The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is
56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of
a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87.
    The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on
wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86.
    Economists pointed out that the government itself had
expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87
economic survey report published last week.
    Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime
Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to
trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for
1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he
said.
    But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously.
They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an
initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees.
    Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya
Janata party, said Gandhi's failure to mention specific
measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices.
    Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as
reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, may
cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by
15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of
1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86
period.
    Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects,
after bad weather last year, may strain prices further.
    Economists said the deficit would also cause the government
to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and
bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up
from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion.
    No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes,
which will discourage savings, economists said.
    Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union
Bank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double to
around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency
notes to cover the deficit.
    Brokers said stock market investors have started selling
long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the
budget that reduces the holding period required to claim
exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three.
    Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, ""There is uncertainty
in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure.""
    But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic
selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the
scene. ""Just now there is acute nervousness in the market,"" he
said.
    Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help
small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the
capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market
on a long-term basis.
    New equity and debenture issues, both convertible and
non-convertible, rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion
rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion
in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85.

JAPAN TO PROMOTE INTEREST RATE LIBERALISATION,"The Bank of Japan decided at a policy
board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation
by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large
deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money
market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.
    The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank
said.
    Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of
regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen
from 300 mln.
    The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of
between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage
point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the
bank said.
    But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less
will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD
rates.
    The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln
yen from 30 mln.
    The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by
0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut
in the official discount rate on February 23.
    New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at
banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum,
respectively.
    Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same.

bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net
income of around 16 mln dlrs.
    The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of
brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.
    Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in
the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit, which
provided computer software for the financial services

    RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market

    It was also given permission last week to open an office in
Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTERITY MEASURES IN HUNGARY,"Hungary is to embark on a new series of
austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled
last year after quadrupling in 1985.
    The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by
Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints.
    But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry's budget
financing division, told Reuters the government now saw this as
too high and had decided ""quite severe"" measures were needed.
    ""All the organizations of economic management have been
charged with elaborating further (savings) measures,"" he said.
    Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: ""The
Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results,
and of course the Fund would support these efforts.""
    IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year.
    Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state
budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last
year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984.
    The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints
because of poor performance by state firms, which needed
subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.
    The exact extent and nature of savings are still under
discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest
budget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said.
    Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low
consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164
billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985.
Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.
    ""I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the
former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,""
Boesze said. ""The central administration must be hard. ... If we
are not hard then we will not be successful.""
    Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve
provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and
800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. ""I believe
these reserves should not be used at all,"" he said.
    Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic
product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.
    The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real
wages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax
penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.
    This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail
price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.
    A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1.
    About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and
33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.
    Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant
cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made
this difficult.
    But he added: ""I think ultimately we will be able to make
curtailments in subsidies in this area as well.""
    He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the
beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and
value added tax. The IMF supports these aims.
    Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an
attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.
    Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be
unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is
being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.
    Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state
by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to
shed labour. He gave no exact figures.
    Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible
for drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped
the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.
    After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single
budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved
for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).
    Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to
more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven
billion in 1986, Boesze said.
    Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year
to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while
trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more
than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years
earlier.
    Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct
by credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10
pct by the issue of domestic state bonds.
    Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian
economists in a speech this month that the country's economy
was in a ""very difficult"" situation, but not in crisis.
    There would have to be a turnround with tangible results
this year, however, and borrowing must be used more
effectively.
    ""Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,""
Berecz said.

DIGITAL AUDIO TAPE PLAYERS GO ON SALE IN JAPAN,"Japanese consumers hesitated about buying
the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on
sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfect
sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.
    ""The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hit
the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying
one,"" said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee.
    Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players
today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers
said. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen.
    Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear
as early as the end of March, industry sources said.
    DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior
to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of
the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue
machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with
almost no loss of sound quality.
    This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape
piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the
DAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry
be built into the machines.
    Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to
prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still
be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.
""Nobody can tell the difference,"" one salesman said.
    DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some
countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties
unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese
hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the
high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a
profitable niche.
    Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly
to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their
products on the market, industry analysts said.
    They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per
year.
    Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT
player on the world market later this year.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ITALIAN BOOM,"Italy's strong economic revival has led
some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some
quarters about future growth prospects, but many Italian
experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive.
    ""I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italian
miracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers always
oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and
unwarranted optimism,"" says Luigi Spaventa, one of Italy's
leading economists and a professor at Rome University.
    According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood have
been occurring for the last 15 years, with Italy one minute
seen as the ""bad boy of Europe"" and unable to raise a dollar and
the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration,
    ""I think there's a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to be
the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign
newspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was another
story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark
room.""
    Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists
here, stress Italy's recent achievements, particularly the
dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial
enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable.
     Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A.,
&lt;FIAT.M> and &lt;ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, the
major state industries are back in the black after years of
losses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of
payments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some
experts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world's
fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism.
    Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it
feels to be its second-rate status among the major
industrialised countries.
    Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this
status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers
from the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States,
Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.
    Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an
agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada
attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned
managing the international monetary system.
    But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems
still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say.
    ""We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,""
warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti.
    He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeed
cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on
the problems still remaining rather than those already solved.
    The country's huge state sector deficit, high unemployment
and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most
worrying problems, experts say.
    The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at
109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion
lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral
again, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luiss
university in Rome.
    Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a
decade in September 1984 and by January this year was running
at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee
international competiveness, economists and industrialists say.
    And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last
October according to the latest official data.
    Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million
people seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were aged
between 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at
17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north.
    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product
(GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct
in 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to
check rising unemployment.
    Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported raw
materials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs.
    This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour last
year, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade
deficit to 3,717 billion lire  by year end from 23,085 billion
lire in 1985.
    But economists say the improvement owes little to any
structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal
of the trend in costs could have serious consequences.
    If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top
industrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket
operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality
information about their activities, economists say.
    Italy has no controls on insider trading.
    The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements
controls -- a European Community directive calls for these to
be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less
blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating
procedures, economists say.
    ""Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse, I
doubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks
which would allow me to do that,"" says Spaventa.

"JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS","Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level
trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are
growing increasingly irritated with each other.
    The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way
for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day
stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.
    Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,
the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to
reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.
    ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanese
government official said. ""But we are also frustrated.""
    The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
but it will, he said.
    He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress
that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
remain when it talks with Congress.
    ""It would only take five minutes to list their
accomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied.
    The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
billion dlrs in Japan's favour.
    On the following two days, the topics will range from
multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade
problems as super computers.
    The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include
savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
    These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
    Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of
boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
    Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is
buying more imports.
    Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial
trade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" one
Japanese official said.
    That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out
bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.
    Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's
trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
action by the U.S., Officials said.
    Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak
bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
overhanging them.
    ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted.
    As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints
about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including
super computers.
    The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese
super computer market.
    The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to
public institutions like universities which buy the
sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up
informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential
sellers, officials said.

EC OPENS ANTI-DUMPING ENQUIRY INTO SOVIET MERCURY,"The European Community Commission said
it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union
is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.
    The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from
EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet
mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the
European industry.
    According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC
had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between
August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of
the EC market if they continue at the same pace.
    The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than
40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to
cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The
imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.
    The Commission said the industry would probably be unable
to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would
result in loss of sales and jobs.

    He did not give details but said, ""It is a very useful
alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that
they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the
Philippines to say exactly the same thing.""
    Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the
country's 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the
debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.
    It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon
bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a
considerable discount from their redemption price.
    It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a
guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no
payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.
    It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond
market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.
    The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries
under the Philippines' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila
is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points
over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring
3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.
    ""(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or
the alternative,"" Ongpin said. ""Our representatives have gone
to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World)
Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury
to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has
generally been positively received.""
    ""We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on
the accounting side,"" Ongpin said. ""We have run this
alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the
government regulators indicated that there will be a problem.""

ARGENTINE DEBT NEGOTIATOR CONFIDENT OF ACCORD,"Argentina's chief debt negotiator
said he was confident of a prompt accord with international
creditor banks for rescheduling the country's foreign debt.
    ""I'm quite optimistic about carrying out a serious and
quick negotiation,"" Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn said on
return from talks in New York with leading U.S. and world
financial officials.
    Argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering
committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet
four pct economic growth targets in 1987. It has also asked for
a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit.
    Brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable, but
Argentina did not want to follow Brazil in suspending payments
on its foreign debt.
    He said Argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to
meet the targets, adding that the banks' attitude had improved
following Brazil's decision.
    The United States and a group of other industrial nations
on Thursday granted Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge loan.
    Brodersohn held talks in New York with U.S. Treasury

MANILA OFFICIALS SPLIT OVER DEBT STRATEGY,"A rift has occured among Philippine
officials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York with
Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chief
negotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement.
    Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin had
decided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging to
fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion
dlrs.
    ""He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as
possible. I'm saying that's very short-sighted,"" Monsod said.
    Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6
billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8
billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource
transfer in the same period.
    Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over
the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
    Monsod said,  ""Right now we are saying to the banks, let's
share the financing burden.""
    Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group of
multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth
facility to bridge the funding gap.
     He said the government and the consultative group would
meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid
donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to
finance any gap on a shared basis.
    He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to
pin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility.
    Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics.
""Secretary Monsod and I get along famously,"" he said. ""She talks
and I listen but I don't necessarily agree.""
    Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging
the financing gap would have aided the government's
pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan.
    She said if private sector investment continued to be held
back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising
interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross
national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over
the next six years.
    ""If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan.
How can there be a program if there is no finance?"" she said,
adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.
    ""It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficult
for the economy to attain its growth targets,"" Monsod said.
    ""Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going
to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not
be able to come back (from New York) in a day,"" she said.
    Monsod, the government's chief economic planner, stressed
Manila's policy was growth before debt.
    She said if the banks refused to lend the new money, the
Philippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezing
all debt repayments.
    ""If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of
the money that you are sending abroad, then of course you have
an option,"" Monsod said. ""You just don't send it abroad. You do a
Brazil.""

TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS,"Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff
cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.,
A senior economic planner said.
    Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic
planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further
reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second
half of this year.
    Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and
Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.
    ""We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs
faster and more substantially,"" he said.
    The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said
the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of
almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as
too selective.
     Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6
billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign
exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made
Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.
    Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened
Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,
particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are
among the island's main export-earners.
    A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington
tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year
limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.
    Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was
limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is
losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given
more generous terms.

"HUTCHISON SEES HIGHER PAYOUT, SATISFACTORY PROFITS","Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK>
expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher
dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
    He did not make any specific projections for the company's
earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of
not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed
four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.
    It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,
equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share
split.
    Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to
property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax
profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln
dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South
China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,
compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it
expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the
remaining shares.
    Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while
its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely
export-led growth.
    Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year
against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.
    But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.
May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect
the British colony.
    He said all of the company's major operations showed
improved results in 1986.
    Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct
interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to
&lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from
Hongkong Electric.
    Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong
Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related
activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local
stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one
share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.
    Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares
from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.
    The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will
give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.
    Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve
Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for
making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from
the government for the spin-off.
    He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets
and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

FEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS,"The U.S. economy continued to expand in
February, but at a slower pace than in January which saw a
spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) said in a report.
    The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9
pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    However, production remained vigorous as more than three
times as many members reported it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel &lt;X>
gradually resumed production.
    An equal number of members reported inventories were higher
and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August
1984.
    For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher
rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc &lt;PBI> said ""the economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new

"FUNARO SAYS BRAZIL NEEDS MORE, FASTER FINANCE","Brazil would not have suspended
payments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more
and faster financing from official lending agencies, Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro said.
    He said he would not seek more money from the International
Monetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and
said Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention.
    ""It's a question of why the official lending agencies don't
finance a little bit more quickly and easily,"" Funaro told
reporters at the Brazilian Embassy.
    Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of
monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if
official lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied,
""Yes, because our country did not receive financing from these
agencies.""
    Asked how long the payment suspension would last, Funaro
said ""It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to
receive from the other side.""
    Brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs,
stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments
on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks.
    Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World
Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the
past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans.
    He said the net transfer was hurting the country's
continued growth and capacity to import goods.
    ""Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to
be found to finance a country like Brazil,"" Funaro said.
    He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he
would like to see ""automatic"" official lending when needed so
that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves,
now reported to be below four billion dlrs.
    Funaro said Brazil had the world's third-largest trade
surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight
billion dlrs.
    But he said that without increased and faster lending from
official institutions, the nation could not rely on its export
earnings to finance development and imports and also service
its debt.
    ""We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and
internal adjustment,"" Funaro said.
    He complained that official lending agencies had imposed
tight control on credit over the past four years, leaving
commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available.
    Funaro said U.S officials understand his position ""but they
don't like it."" Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe
and debt discussions with officials in Britain, West Germany,
France, Switzerland and Italy.
    Brazil's central cank President Francisco Gros said he sent
a telex to creditor banks Friday to clarify confusion over
Brazil's request that banks expedite procedures for renewal of
short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines.

AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS,"American Express Co, rumored to be
considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
broadening international competition.
    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
the actions under consideration are an integral part of
American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
that the two companies have been having both internal and
external discussions on the matters.
    American Express said no decision has been reached on the
strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
decide to follow growth plans already in place.
    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
    There was some speculation that American Express had also
considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
to a Friday close at 74.
     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
similar statement was being circulated to employees.
    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
pct in the last year.
    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
    American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
""(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
capital if they need to,"" said Larry Eckenfelder of
Prudential-Bache Securities.
    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
     The reorganization also created four new positions for
chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
growth and positioning in the global market competition.
    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

SWISS HAVE NET GAIN IN 1985 GOVERNMENT FINANCES,"Switzerland recorded last year its first
overall surplus in government finances since 1974, ending with
a net gain worth 905 mln Swiss francs, the Finance Ministry
said.
    The surplus, including cash transactions and long-term
investments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion
francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986
budget.
    All categories of revenues were higher than forecast, and
expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast.
    The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18
billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61
billion proposed in the original 1986 budget.
    Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985
figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71
billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling
1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985
deficit of 696 mln.
    Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above
forecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expected
receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions.
    Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than
planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said.
    The ministry said the improvement in the overall account
reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to
introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax
increases. But economic factors, including the low rate of
inflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oil
prices were also important factors.
    A spokesman for the ministry said the government had used
its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs
of government debt, which accounted for the difference between
the 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mln
franc overall surplus.

APPLE COMPUTER &lt;AAPL> UPGRADES MACINTOSH LINE,"Apple Computer Inc today will
announce the addition of two new machines to its profitable
Macintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at the
business market.
    The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has
been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new
machines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be faster
and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than
earlier models.
    The Mac SE (SE stands for ""system expansion""), which Apple
says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus,
goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging
from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features.
    The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster than
the Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and priced
between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs.
    Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for
about 2,200 dlrs.
    Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld
Conference in Los Angeles.
    Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers
at a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performance
Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the
expanding market for science and engineering workstations.
    John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer,
declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SE
should contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line this
year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.
    ""I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for
most people,"" he said. ""My sense is that it will be a real
power product for revenue.""
    Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp;
Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computers
but expected the new products to do well.
    ""Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of
computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation,""
he told Reuters. ""The graphics interface on the Mac products is
significantly better than anything IBM has to date.""
    International Business Machines is expected to announce
updated personal computers this spring.
    The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor, an
""open architecture"" that allows for the addition of numerous
peripheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of
memory, expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped with
a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor.
    In a demonstration of its speed and power, company
executives said they thought the Mac II would push the
development of software for Apple computers in new directions
that could include sophisticated video editing, electronic mail
systems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use.
    The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256
colors or shades of gray.
    The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor and
will be shipped with one megabyte RAM, expandable to four
megabytes, and a nine-inch monochrome screen.

feature in the Apple line of products.

LL/E ROYALTY &lt;LRT> REVENUES MAY BE ESCROWED,"LL and E Royalty Trust said Louisiana
Land and Exploration Co &lt;LLX>, the working interest owner for
its oil and natural gas properties, is entitled to start
placing all or part of the revenues that would otherwise accrue
to the trust.
    LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed any
amounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine the
necessity of doing so.  The trust said ""If the working interest
owner does begin to escrow funds, the effect on the royalties
paid to the trust would be significant.""  Royalties from the
properties are the trust's only source of income.
    The trust said independent petroleum engineers' preliminary
annual estimates of future net revenues and the discounted
present value of future net revenues from proved oil and
natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the
trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively
from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural
gas prices.
    It said, however, that oil and natural gas reserves have
actually increased in physical amount.  The cost estimates
reflect prices and costs only through September 30.
    The trust said using the September figures, the engineers
determined estimated future net revenues to the trust from
total proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs.  Usingprices
received in January 1987, however, it said the estimate would
have been about 87 mln dlrs.  LL and E noted that there has
been some weakening in prices since January.
    The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in
estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama
and Florida, a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986,
as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production
costs after expenses of nitrogen injection.

PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH>,"New Jersey-based overnight messenger
Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for
about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
another courier company.
    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
courier operations.
    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
complete the transaction. This so-called ""bridge"" financing
will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
    ""Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
serious competitor in the future,"" said Idsal.
    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier
division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
    The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
    The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from
the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire
20 business days after commencement unless extended.

U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - ASSET-BACK MARKET GROWS,"The U.S. asset-backed debt securities
market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and
investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.
    ""It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed
deals of the year were done by commercial banks,"" said Anthony
Dub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group.
    BankAmerica Corp's &lt;BAC> Bank of America unit last week
issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card
receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the
offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.
    The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of
200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's &lt;RPT>
RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books
on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.
    However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more
closely related to the so-called ""cars deals"" that raced to
market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.
    ""The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card
receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the
first public offering of credit card receivables because we
used a grantor trust vehicle,"" he said.
    In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates
that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest
in the trust, analysts explained.
    The Bank of America certificates were issued by California
Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single
purpose, investment bankers pointed out.
    The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in
1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced
it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over
comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal
was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the
Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. ""AAA-rated
auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries
when First Boston priced the deal,"" one said.
    However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.
    The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's
top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's
cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone.
    ""Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18
months and then interest and principal payments for the
remaining five to seven months,"" Dub detailed.
    Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of
America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the
issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals
that were brought to market late last year.
    The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit
card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America
has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making
it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.
    Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into
the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.
    In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California
Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed
by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.
    Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes
backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a
unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and
450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks
Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc &lt;MACK>, via
Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.
    The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals
an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.

REAGAN AND BAKER BEGIN TASK OF REBUILDING,"After a week that left his presidency
shaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and his
new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an
administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal.
    Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker,
whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan
praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing
criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with
Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon.
    Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle is
assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has
done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey
as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
    White House officials are checking to see how much support
Gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have
if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote,
Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said.
    Appearing on the NBC News program, ""Meet the Press,"" the
Kansas senator said the Gates nomination ""could be in some
difficulty.""
    Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority
by Baker.
    Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale
scandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates
nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only
after months of congressional probes into the affair.
    ""He has the smell of Iran on him,"" said former Nevada Sen.
and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt. ""He is a victim.""
    Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, ""This Week With
David Brinkley,"" bluntly admitted ""the Gates nomination is in
trouble."" Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said
the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates.
    When asked on the syndicated television program, ""John
McLaughlin: One on One,"" if he thought Gates would be confirmed,
the Georgia Democrat shot back: ""I wouldn't bet any money on it.
    ""I think this report hurts that,"" Nunn said. ""It indicates
that the National Security Council had policy-type influence
over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into
that with Mr. Gates.
    Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower report
prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief
of staff.
    Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasury
secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past
two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the
botched handling of the Iran arms sale.
    The report blamed Regan for the ""chaos that descended on the
White House"" since it was first revealed last November that
profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra
rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.
    The two other victims of the scandal are former National
Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was
disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale
were diverted to the contras. The two, pictured by the Tower
commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, have
refused to testify.
    Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed
in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose
inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy.
    That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity and
threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves
office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found
that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership,
a record low, and a third believed he should consider
resignation.
    After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over
the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen.
John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television
address this week to respond to the criticisms of his
presidency.

CHEUNG KONG CHAIRMAN SEES STRONG RESULTS IN 1987,"Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd &lt;CKGH.HK>
is expecting strong results this year after reporting better
than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
    He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told
reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19
cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a
four-for-one stock split.
    The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15
cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus
issue.
    Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in
1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion
dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln
dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel
to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> for one billion
dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local
property market and substantial increases in contributions from
associated companies.
    ""Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for
the property market,"" Li said. ""The growth in (Hong Kong's)
exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial
buildings.""
    Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in
